    <h1>Info</h1>
    <p>Washer / Dryer Projects is a gallery in Mitchell Barton's laundry room in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.</p>
    <p>The gallery functions as an unconventional space where artists can experiment in an abnormal/less-than-ideal art context. We don't normally have openings or events ~ the space is committed to being mostly private and inaccessible in a physical sense, but all work can be viewed on this website.</p>
    <p>The gallery is sometimes open when the laundry room is being used to do laundry.</p>
    <p>Shows in the gallery are up for 6 weeks.</p>
    <p>Currently doing laundry: No</p>
